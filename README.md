## Purpose ##

The AF-Helper is an application designed to be used by physicians to help manage patients with atrial fibrillation.

* *CHADS-VASc calculator*: Users will answer a series of questions by selecting the correct option. Each answer will be associated with a score. The system will add the scores as the user answers each question. Once all the questions have been answered, the application will return the total score which is the CHADs-VASc score.
* *Stroke risk evaluator*: Based on the CHADS-VASc score, the application will inform the user if the patient is at a low, medium or high risk of stroke. If the risk is medium or high, the user will be asked if they would like to select an anticoagulant therapy for the patient.

    * View CHADS-VASc results for a patient
